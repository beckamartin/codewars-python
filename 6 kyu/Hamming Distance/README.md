# Hamming Distance
#### Description:

The [Hamming Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

**Examples:**

    a = "I like turtles"
    b = "I like turkeys"
    Result: 3

    a = "Hello World"
    b = "Hello World"
    Result: 0

    a = "espresso"
    b = "Expresso"
    Result: 2

You can assume that the two input strings are of equal length.
